# Catching-Flies-in-a-TPot-with-Honey

This Repository serves as proof of documentation for a blog I have written for my Honeypot report that I've made for a Final project for my Cybersecurity Course.  The Full blog can be found by following this link: https://systemweakness.com/catching-flies-in-a-tpot-with-honey-2a069b12317d  or searching up the title "**Catching Flies in a Tpot with Honey**", As it is published on Medium.com and systemweakness.com.

Disclaimer: I'd like to use this repository as a way for recruiters to read up on my projects and see the work that I have done. Although I am leaving it open to the public for educational purposes and spread knowledge on such issues that are mentioned within my blog.
